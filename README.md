Rock Paper Scissors using Java Script for The Odin Project. 

Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors, written in JavaScript. This project was created as an exercise for The Odin Project's curriculum.

How to Play

The rules of the game are simple: each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors, and the winner is determined based on the following:

Rock beats scissors
Scissors beats paper
Paper beats rock

To play the game, simply open the index.html file in your browser and click on the "Play" button. You will be prompted to enter your choice of rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer will randomly choose its own. The winner will be displayed on the screen.

Files Included

This project includes the following files:

index.html: the HTML file that displays the game
style.css: the CSS file that styles the game
script.js: the JavaScript file that implements the game logic

How to Modify

If you want to modify the game, you can do so by editing the script.js file. The game logic is contained in the playRound() function, which takes two arguments (the player's choice and the computer's choice) and returns a string indicating the winner.

You can also modify the styling of the game by editing the style.css file.
